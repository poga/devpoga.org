  # Since this template is static, the contact form uses www.formspree.io as a

  # email. Visitors can send up to a 1000 emails each month for free.
  #
  # What you need to do for the setup?
  #
  # - set your email address under 'email' below
  # - upload the generated site to your server
  # - send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
  # - click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
  # - you're done. Happy mailing!
