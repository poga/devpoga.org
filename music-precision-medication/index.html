# Music as Precision Medicine

![](./IMG_1531.jpg)
I make music in a unique way - limited to about two hours of sound exposure daily before headaches set in. This constraint has transformed my approach.

I work with laser focus, like a doctor administering the perfect dose. During "off hours" I study sound theory to maximize my productive time. I prepare thoroughly before studio sessions, sketching ideas in silence so I can execute efficiently when the clock starts.

Time constraints quickly reveal what truly matters. I've learned that silence is as valuable as sound - it's where ideas crystallize. Deep understanding comes from studying music's structure and evolution rather than endless listening. I emphasize quality over quantity: fewer elements that each serve a clear purpose.

This limitation has become my greatest strength. I create with intention, making every note count.
