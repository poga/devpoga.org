# Music as Precision Medicine

![](./IMG_1531.jpg)

I make music in a unique way - limited to about two hours of sound exposure daily before headaches set in. This constraint has transformed my approach.

I maximize the enjoyment of these precious hours. Rather than rushing through with clinical precision, I immerse myself in the experience. My practice draws from diverse music history and culture, sampling, chopping, and remixing to create tributes to the sounds that inspire me.

During "off hours" I research musical traditions and techniques without headphones, developing ideas that I can later bring to life. These quiet periods aren't empty - they're when connections form in my mind.

Time constraints have revealed what truly matters. I've learned to value both sound and silence equally. My limitations guide me toward thoughtful production: fewer elements with greater purpose and meaning.

This constraint has become my creative advantage. I create with intention and appreciation, honoring musical heritage while crafting something new in my limited window of opportunity.
