# Music as Precision Medicine

![](./IMG_1531.jpg)

I make music in a unique way - limited to about two hours of sound exposure daily before headaches set in. Those two hours are my precision medicine - carefully timed, perfectly dosed, and specifically formulated for maximum effect.

I plan each session like a curated tour through a specific slice of music culture. One day might be dedicated to exploring 70s funk basslines, another to West African percussion patterns. Rather than rushing through techniques, I immerse myself completely in one tradition at a time.

During "off hours" I research these musical worlds without headphones, developing ideas that I can later transform. These quiet periods aren't empty - they're when connections form in my mind between different eras and styles.

My limitations have guided me toward thoughtful production. I've learned to create tributes to the sounds that inspire me through deliberate sampling, chopping, and remixing. My tracks contain fewer elements, each chosen with purpose to honor musical heritage.

This constraint has become my creative advantage. Like precision medicine tailored to a specific condition, my limited window of opportunity leads to more intentional, focused, and ultimately more meaningful music.
