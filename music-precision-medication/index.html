# Music as Precision Medicine

![](./IMG_1531.jpg)

I make music, but in a pretty unique way.

I can only work with sound for about two hours a day before I get serious headaches. So I've learned to be super focusedâ€”like a doctor giving the right dose of medicine.

No extra stuff, just what matters.

When I'm not actually making music, I love studying how different sounds work and why people connect with them. It's made me really intentional about every beat and note I create.

---

Music gives me headaches. Literally.

Two hours of focused sound - that's my limit before pain takes over. Not just a little discomfort, but the kind that shuts everything down.

I want those two hours to really matter.

No more wasting time scrolling through endless sounds or second-guessing myself.

I need to show up prepared, knowing what I want to do.

I want to sketch out ideas beforehand, in quiet, so when I sit down with actual sound, I can just get to work.

When the clock is always ticking, you figure out what's important real quick. That's the unexpected gift in all this.

I need to value the silence as much as the sound. Those quiet periods aren't empty or wasted - they're when everything comes together in my head. I want to develop ideas while walking around, cooking dinner, or just sitting without any music playing. Create intensely, then step back. Like breathing in and out.

I want to use my limited sound tolerance to understand music in different ways. To spend more time learning about how genres evolved and why certain sounds hit people just right.

I want to trace where techniques came from without blasting music for hours. To see the patterns - how a style is built, what gives it that special feel, why certain sound combinations make us feel something.

While other producers might absorb influence by listening constantly, I want to map out sound through study and careful listening. Reading the blueprint instead of attending every concert.

I want my tracks to have fewer parts that each do more work.

Not just because I have to, but because it's actually better that way.

To make complex ideas clear without layers that become painful as my ears get tired.

I need to make everything count. One good bass line instead of three okay ones. Space that's there on purpose, not just filler.

Quality over quantity in every choice.
