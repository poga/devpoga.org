<h2 id="the-natural-pitfalls">The Natural pitfalls</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>absence of trust</strong>: unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group.</li>
<li><strong>fear of conflict</strong>: incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. They resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments</li>
<li><strong>lack of commitment</strong>: team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign aggrement during meetings.</li>
<li><strong>avoidance of accountability</strong>: hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.</li>
<li><strong>Inattention to results</strong>: team members put their needs above the collective goals of the team.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-questionnaire">A questionnaire</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>____ 1. Team members are passionate and unguarded in their discussion of issues.

____ 6. Team members openly admit their weaknesses and mistakes.
____ 7. Team meetings are compelling, and not boring.
____ 8. Team members leave meetings confident that their peers are completely committed to the decisions that were agreed on, even if there was initial disagreement.

____ 10. During team meetings, the most important—and difficult—issues are put on the table to be resolved.

____ 12. Team members know about one another's personal lives and are comfortable discussing them.
____ 13. Team members end discussions with clear and specific resolutions and calls to action.
