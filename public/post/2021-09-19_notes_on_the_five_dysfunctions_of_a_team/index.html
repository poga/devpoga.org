<li><strong>fear of conflict</strong>: incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. They resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments</li>
<li><strong>lack of commitment</strong>: team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign aggrement during meetings.</li>
<li><strong>avoidance of accountability</strong>: hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.</li>
<li><strong>Inattention to results</strong>: team members put their needs above the collective goals of the team.</li>
</ol>
