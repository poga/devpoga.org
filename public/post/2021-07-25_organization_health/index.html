<p>Members of a leadership team can gain a general sense of their organization’s health and, more important, identify specific opportunities for improvement by completing the following checklist.</p>
<h2 id="discipline-1-build-a-cohesive-leadership-team">Discipline 1: Build a Cohesive Leadership Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>The leadership team is small enough (three to ten people) to be effective.</li>
<li>Members of the team trust one another and can be genuinely vulnerable with each other.</li>
<li>Team members regularly engage in productive, unfiltered conflict around important issues.</li>
<li>The team leaves meetings with clear-cut, active, and specific agreements around decisions.</li>
<li>Team members hold one another accountable to commitments and behaviors.</li>
<li>Members of the leadership team are focused on team number one. They put the collective priorities and needs of the larger organization ahead of their own departments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discipline-2-create-clarity">Discipline 2: Create Clarity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Members of the leadership team know, agree on, and are passionate about the reason that the organization exists.</li>
<li>The leadership team has clarified and embraced a small, specific set of behavioral values.</li>
<li>Leaders are clear and aligned around a strategy that helps them define success and differentiate from competitors.</li>
<li>The leadership team has a clear, current goal around which they rally. They feel a collective sense of ownership for that goal.</li>
<li>Members of the leadership team understand one another’s roles and responsibilities. They are comfortable asking questions about one another’s work.</li>
<li>The elements of the organization’s clarity are concisely summarized and regularly referenced and reviewed by the leadership team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discipline-3-overcommunicate-clarity">Discipline 3: Overcommunicate Clarity</h2>
<ul>
<li>The leadership team has clearly communicated the six aspects of clarity to all employees.</li>
<li>Team members regularly remind the people in their departments about those aspects of clarity.</li>
<li>The team leaves meetings with clear and specific agreements about what to communicate to their employees, and they cascade those messages quickly after meetings.</li>
<li>Employees are able to accurately articulate the organization’s reason for existence, values, strategic anchors, and goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discipline-4-reinforce-clarity">Discipline 4: Reinforce Clarity</h2>
<ul>
<li>The organization has a simple way to ensure that new hires are carefully selected based on the company’s values.</li>
<li>New people are brought into the organization by thoroughly teaching them about the six elements of clarity.</li>
<li>Managers throughout the organization have a simple, consistent, and nonbureaucratic system for setting goals and reviewing progress with employees. That system is customized around the elements of clarity.</li>
<li>Employees who don’t fit the values are managed out of the organization. Poor performers who do fit the values are given the coaching and assistance they need to succeed.</li>
<li>Compensation and reward systems are built around the values and goals of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tactical and strategic discussions are addressed in separate meetings.</li>
<li>During tactical staff meetings, agendas are set only after the team has reviewed its progress against goals. Noncritical administrative topics are easily discarded.</li>
<li>During topical meetings, enough time is allocated to major issues to allow for clarification, debate, and resolution.</li>
<li>The team meets quarterly away from the office to review what is happening in the industry, in the organization, and on the team.</li>
</ul>
