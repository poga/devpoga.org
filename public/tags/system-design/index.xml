      <description>Resources you&amp;rsquo;re going to encounter in your career, from least malleable to most malleable:
People Process Code Always start with the people. People are shaped by their life. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to rapidly change a person without some crazy stuff happen.
Run if people make you feel uncomfortable. Since It&amp;rsquo;s not worthy to spend your life to change some other people just to have an okay career.
Processes can be changed. But processes are tied to incentives.</description>
