      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a burnt-out programmer, never an artist. Okay?
I&amp;rsquo;m a typical burnt-out programmer due to typical reasons. And this time, it&amp;rsquo;s particularly bad.
I literally want to throw up multiple times when I&amp;rsquo;m coding this damn game and also struggling to finish the game.
But I still made it across the finish line. The game sucks so much that I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it can be called a game. But I made it.</description>

      <description>When I started using Godot Engine, what surprised me the most is the built-in Language Server Protocol support. Thank to it, I can easily develop GDScript with all my customized vim configs.
Setup Install vim-godot.
Plug &amp;#39;habamax/vim-godot&amp;#39; Install neovim-remote.
pip3 install neovim-remote Setup Neovim as the external editor for Godot
Open menu Editor/Editor Settings/ then navigate to General/External/: Tick Use external editor Set nvr to Exec Path, use which nvr to get the absolute path.</description>

      <description>Some years ago, Unity dominated the game engine market. Everyone would recommend Unity to fellow game developers without thinking.
However, Unity (as a game engine) is not in a great shape right now:
Deprecating features while the replacement isn’t ready, Creating multiple new implementations of features from scratch instead of improving what’s there. Abandoning their own features in favour of acquiring community-made versions, and then abandoning them, Splitting the whole render system into two incompatible, contrary versions, deprecating the previous render system.</description>
