  "articleBody": " Members of a leadership team can gain a general sense of their organization’s health and, more important, identify specific opportunities for improvement by completing the following checklist.\nDiscipline 1: Build a Cohesive Leadership Team The leadership team is small enough (three to ten people) to be effective. Members of the team trust one another and can be genuinely vulnerable with each other. Team members regularly engage in productive, unfiltered conflict around important issues. The team leaves meetings with clear-cut, active, and specific agreements around decisions. Team members hold one another accountable to commitments and behaviors. Members of the leadership team are focused on team number one. They put the collective priorities and needs of the larger organization ahead of their own departments. Discipline 2: Create Clarity Members of the leadership team know, agree on, and are passionate about the reason that the organization exists. The leadership team has clarified and embraced a small, specific set of behavioral values. Leaders are clear and aligned around a strategy that helps them define success and differentiate from competitors. The leadership team has a clear, current goal around which they rally. They feel a collective sense of ownership for that goal. Members of the leadership team understand one another’s roles and responsibilities. They are comfortable asking questions about one another’s work. The elements of the organization’s clarity are concisely summarized and regularly referenced and reviewed by the leadership team. Discipline 3: Overcommunicate Clarity The leadership team has clearly communicated the six aspects of clarity to all employees. Team members regularly remind the people in their departments about those aspects of clarity. The team leaves meetings with clear and specific agreements about what to communicate to their employees, and they cascade those messages quickly after meetings. Employees are able to accurately articulate the organization’s reason for existence, values, strategic anchors, and goals. Discipline 4: Reinforce Clarity The organization has a simple way to ensure that new hires are carefully selected based on the company’s values. New people are brought into the organization by thoroughly teaching them about the six elements of clarity. Managers throughout the organization have a simple, consistent, and nonbureaucratic system for setting goals and reviewing progress with employees. That system is customized around the elements of clarity. Employees who don’t fit the values are managed out of the organization. Poor performers who do fit the values are given the coaching and assistance they need to succeed. Compensation and reward systems are built around the values and goals of the organization. Meetings Tactical and strategic discussions are addressed in separate meetings. During tactical staff meetings, agendas are set only after the team has reviewed its progress against goals. Noncritical administrative topics are easily discarded. During topical meetings, enough time is allocated to major issues to allow for clarification, debate, and resolution. The team meets quarterly away from the office to review what is happening in the industry, in the organization, and on the team. ",
