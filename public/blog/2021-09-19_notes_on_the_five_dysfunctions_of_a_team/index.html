<meta name="description" content="
genuine teamwork in most organizations remains as elusive as it has ever been.
organizations fail to achieve teamwork because they unknowingly fall prey to five natural but dangerous pitfalls



The Natural pitfalls

absence of trust: unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group.
fear of conflict: incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. They resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments
lack of commitment: team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign aggrement during meetings.
avoidance of accountability: hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.
Inattention to results: team members put their needs above the collective goals of the team.

A questionnaire
____ 1. Team members are passionate and unguarded in their discussion of issues.
____ 2. Team members call out one another&#39;s deficiencies or unproductive behaviors.
____ 3. Team members know what their peers are working on and how they contribute to the collective good of the team.
____ 4. Team members quickly and genuinely apologize to one another when they say or do something inappropriate or possibly damaging to the team.
____ 5. Team members willingly make sacrifices (such as budget, turf, head count) in their departments or areas of expertise for the good of the team.
____ 6. Team members openly admit their weaknesses and mistakes.
____ 7. Team meetings are compelling, and not boring.
____ 8. Team members leave meetings confident that their peers are completely committed to the decisions that were agreed on, even if there was initial disagreement.
____ 9. Morale is significantly affected by the failure to achieve team goals.
____ 10. During team meetings, the most important—and difficult—issues are put on the table to be resolved.
____ 11. Team members are deeply concerned about the prospect of letting down their peers.
____ 12. Team members know about one another&#39;s personal lives and are comfortable discussing them.
____ 13. Team members end discussions with clear and specific resolutions and calls to action.
____ 14. Team members challenge one another about their plans and approaches.
____ 15. Team members are slow to seek credit for their own contributions, but quick to point out those of others.

<h2 id="the-natural-pitfalls">The Natural pitfalls<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-natural-pitfalls">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>absence of trust</strong>: unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group.</li>
<li><strong>fear of conflict</strong>: incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. They resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments</li>
<li><strong>lack of commitment</strong>: team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign aggrement during meetings.</li>
<li><strong>avoidance of accountability</strong>: hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.</li>
<li><strong>Inattention to results</strong>: team members put their needs above the collective goals of the team.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-questionnaire">A questionnaire<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-questionnaire">#</a></h2>

____ 10. During team meetings, the most important—and difficult—issues are put on the table to be resolved.
____ 11. Team members are deeply concerned about the prospect of letting down their peers.
____ 12. Team members know about one another&#39;s personal lives and are comfortable discussing them.
____ 13. Team members end discussions with clear and specific resolutions and calls to action.
