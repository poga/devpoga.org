  <p>Resources you&rsquo;re going to encounter in your career, from least malleable to most malleable:</p>
<ol>
<li>People</li>
<li>Process</li>
<li>Code</li>
</ol>
<p>Always start with the people. People are shaped by their life. It&rsquo;s impossible to rapidly change a person without some crazy stuff happen.</p>
<p>Run if people make you feel uncomfortable. Since It&rsquo;s not worthy to spend your life to change some other people just to have an okay career.</p>
<hr>
<p>Processes can be changed. But processes are tied to incentives.</p>
<p>Work on incentives if you find working with these people fun and energize you. Because a good incentive can multiple the outcome and happiness for the same group of people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Work on the code last.</p>
<p>Codes are always malleable. They can be easily changed to fit pretty much any requirement.</p>
<p>Find right people, give them good processes, then, figure out whatever code you need to deliver value.</p>
