To build the solution we will create a model of the problem domain, extracting only the aspects of the domain that are relevant and then re-creating them in our solution space\nbounded contexts as autonomous software components In general, an event used for communication between contexts will not be just a simple signal but will also contain all the data that the downstream components need to process the event.\ntrust boundaries and validation The perimeter of a bounded context acts as a “trust boundary.” Anything inside the bounded context will be trusted and valid, while anything outside the bounded context will be untrusted and might be invalid.\nThe job of the output gate is different. Its job is to ensure that private information doesn’t leak out of the bounded context, both to avoid accidental coupling between contexts and for security reasons.\nContracts between bounded contexts A Shared Kernel relationship is where two contexts share some common domain design, so the teams involved must collaborate. A Customer/Supplier or Consumer Driven Contract relationship is where the downstream context defines the contract that they want the upstream context to provide. A Conformist relationship is the opposite of consumer-driven. The downstream context accepts the contract provided by the upstream context and adapts its own domain model to match. Anti-Corruption Layer in DDD terminology, often abbreviated as “ACL.” In the diagram above, the “input gate” often plays the role of the ACL—it prevents the internal, pure domain model from being “corrupted” by knowledge of the outside world. build a context map with relationships\nworkflow within a bounded context The input to a workflow is always the data associated with a command, and the output is always a set of events to communicate to other contexts.\navoid domain events within a bounded context\ncode structure within a bounded context use onion architecture ~= clean architecture\nkeep IO at the edges\nUnderstanding Types represent a domain with ADTs\nAND types = product types = records OR types = SUM types = enums Domain modeling with types Use type systems to capture the domain model accurately and can be read and understood by domain experts.\nsimple types + sum/product types + functions\nfunctions = workflows\nIntegrity and Consistency in the Domain parse, don’t validate https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/\nlots of examples…\nCapturing Business Rules in the Type System ex.\ntype​ CustomerEmail = ​ | Unverified ​of​ EmailAddress ​ | Verified ​of​ VerifiedEmailAddress ​// different from normal EmailAddress​ type​ SendPasswordResetEmail = VerifiedEmailAddress -\u003e ...

This style of programming is sometimes called “transformation-oriented programming.”\nFollowing functional programming principles, we’ll ensure each step in the pipeline is designed to be stateless and without side effects, which means each step can be tested and understood independently.
