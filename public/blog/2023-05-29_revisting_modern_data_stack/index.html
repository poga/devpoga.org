The demands of teams are so complex that we must break apart the whole thing into smaller, more manageable chunks. Sales get their metric, and Marketing gets theirs.

In theory it provided the ability for smaller companies to only pay for what they needed in terms of consumption and data infrastructure size. Meaning they didn‚Äôt need to sign a 7-figure contract for 5 years in order to test out a few ideas they might have.\nThat continues to work but in some cases it‚Äôs a lot of work to put all those pieces together. So we have a 2nd or possibly 3rd generation of all-in-one tools that have become popular. They often offer a price per consumption based model which allows teams that can‚Äôt afford a massive contract to consider using said solutions(not all the solutions I am currently looking at do so, such as Incorta). But most do.\nHow Scale Kills Data Teams https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/how-scale-kills-data-teams\nI disagree with all of these approaches. Moving fast is good.

DFS achieves this through infrastructure-as-code capabilities to create and deploy config files or new resources and decide how to provision, deploy, and manage them.

For example, in object oriented design the aim is to organise the program around ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, which are coherent groupings of¬†behaviour¬†(ie: code), the data is often simply along for the ride. Writing programs with MnTable is different: you group the data into¬†tables¬†and then the code lives separately.
