External and internal threats exist on the network at all times. Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network. Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized. Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible. Traditional approach(perimeter model): break networks into zones, different level of trust by zone.\nIf we instead declare that network location has no value, VPN is suddenly rendered obsolete.\nZero Trust Control Plane Requests for access to protected resources are first made through the control plane, where both the device and user must be authenticated and authorized.\nOnce the control plane has decided that the request will be allowed, it dynamically configures the data plane to accept traffic from that client (and that client only).\nThe zero trust model dictates that all hosts be treated as if they’re internet-facing. The networks they reside in must be considered compromised and hostile.\nManaging Trust Trust management is the most important component of a zero trust network.\nDefine threat model. The Internet environment has a fairly well understood threat model. In general, we assume that the end-systems engaging in a protocol exchange have not themselves been compromised.
