      # I blog with raw HTML

      The blog you're reading is written in raw HTML.

      The blog have many reincarnations, the longest lived one is based on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

      However, even a static site generator will deprecate some features one day. and my words need to follow the convention of that static site generator.

      And one day, the blog is broken.

      Therefore, the blog you're reading now is written in raw HTML, with [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me/) for markdown, and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting.

      Browsers are powerful today, with built-in audio and video players.

      More importantly, Browsers and HTML are never deprecated.

      And I don't have to endlessly search for a theme that fits my taste.
