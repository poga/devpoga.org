      # I blog by writing directly for the web browers

      The blog you're reading is written directly for web browsers. no extra build step.

      The blog have many reincarnations, the longest lived one is based on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

      However, even a static site generator will deprecate some features one day. and my words need to follow the convention of that static site generator.

      And one day, the blog is broken. And I don't want my blog to have a build step anymore.

      Therefore, the blog you're reading now is written directly for the browers, with [md-block](https://md-block.verou.me/) for markdown, and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for syntax highlighting.

      Browsers are powerful today, with built-in audio and video players.

      More importantly, Browsers and HTML are never deprecated.

      And I don't have to endlessly search for a theme that fits my taste.
