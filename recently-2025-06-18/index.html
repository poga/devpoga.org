## Body

I started weight training this year and have been making steady progress.

## Reading

I went through the famous [Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Companies-Finance/dp/1119610885), but I don't like it. It's a typical business textbook that uses a lot of hand-wavy math and cherry-picked empirical data. The authors emphasize that many issues of capitalism are due to the lack of focus on long-term value. But in my opinion, as long as externalities are the core concept of capitalism, the "long-term value" is just a myth for today's business.

[How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fascism-Works-Politics-Them/dp/0525511830) and [On Tyranny](https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119) are both extremely relevant to today's world. They are both short and easy to read.

I've been spending more time on art projects: music, games, drawing. [What Art Does: An Unfinished Theory](https://www.amazon.com/What-Art-Does-Unfinished-Theory/dp/0571395511) is a good read on the topic, and I agree with the author on many of the topics. "Play is how children learn, and art is how adults play."

Also, I brought back the habit of buying physical books. The texture of paper still helps me focus more on the content.

## Music Production

I'm being more intentional about my music production. Currently, I'm focusing on the classic hip-hop approach: sampling, chopping, turntablism, live performing, and beat making. Flipping samples has a lot of commonalities with hacking. It's about understanding something deeply and transforming it into something new and unique. It's a creative process that requires both technical skill and artistic vision.

Also, I learned that I don't really enjoy arranging and composing music. I can produce much faster by focusing on a loop and hacking around it live: adding/removing layers, live effects, finger drumming, and improvisation. It's a more organic and intuitive way of making music.

## Games

It's been a busy 6 months, and I don't have much time to play games. I'm playing Monster Train 2 currently, and it's a good rogue-like. The difficulty ramp is a little bit unbalanced but mostly fine.
