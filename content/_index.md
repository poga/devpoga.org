## Hi! I'm Poga.

You can contact me via [email](mailto://hi@devpoga.org) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/devpoga).

I work on interconnecting things in different domains such as tech, game, design, privacy, and security. In no particular order of preference:

- [g0v.social](https://g0v.social), a self-sustainable decentralized social network.

- Machine Learning: resources for Federated learning, [Awesome Federated Learning](https://github.com/poga/awesome-federated-learning).

- I've been thinking about [glue systems](/tags/glues/) a lot.

...as well as many other [open-source projects](https://github.com/poga).
