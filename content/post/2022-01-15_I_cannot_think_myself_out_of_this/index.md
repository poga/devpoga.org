> When I was depressed, I distinctly remembering having discovered: "I cannot think myself out of this!"
> Unlike most things in my life, which I could think myself out of (quite successfully!), this one I could not. That had a pretty profound effect on my core epistemology thereafter.

> The thing which really helped me was retreating to my friends and family (who, thankfully, could get me out of my own head).

> In my own experience, and in working with people with severe depression, I have found two things to be almost universal. One is that the pathway out involves better noticing of small shifts in consciousness in the present moment - depression is a flatland, yet even within it there are small tiny windows of light that can be noticed and built on.

> The other is that, and this especially applies to people that live inside their head, are very smart, very analytical, etc...the body itself provides a pathway out. Without even getting into somatic psychology, the act of doing things where one is experiencing felt sensation in the body provides a ground for consciousness outside of the grey hazy thought world.


Maybe the first step for me is to make myself look good. Clothing, body shaping, workout, and cleanness.
