The first step is always the hardest.

### The dreadful blank canvas

The blank canvas is perfect.

We afraid to change the perfect canvas. The first step, the first paint must also be perfect.

A blank canvas does not have a single mistake on it. But it's does not have a single useful thing on it, too.

### Brute-force the first step

Just draw the first line, write the first function.

Start hack together a runnable program. Types and structures can come later.

In order to be useful, it needs to be imperfect first.
