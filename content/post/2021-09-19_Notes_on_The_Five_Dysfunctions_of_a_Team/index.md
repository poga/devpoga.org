* genuine teamwork in most organizations remains as elusive as it has ever been.

![](/post/2021-09-19_notes_on_the_five_dysfunctions_of_a_team/0.png)

## The Natural pitfalls

1. **absence of trust**: unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group.
2. **fear of conflict**: incapable of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate of ideas. They resort to veiled discussions and guarded comments
3. **lack of commitment**: team members rarely, if ever, buy in and commit to decisions, though they may feign aggrement during meetings.
4. **avoidance of accountability**: hesitate to call their peers on actions and behaviors that seem counterproductive to the good of the team.
5. **Inattention to results**: team members put their needs above the collective goals of the team.
