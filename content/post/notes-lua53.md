[Notes on the Implementation on Lua 5.3](https://poga.github.io/lua53-notes/) is a collection of my notes on the Lua 5.3 source code. It's a mix of both high-level ideas and interesting details in the source code.

There can be errors. Feel free to contact me if you have any question or feedback.

## Why Lua?

In the world of embeddable scripting language, Lua is still the most well-known solution. It's lightweight enough to run on mobile phones, IoT devices. The implementation is simple, efficient, and portable, which makes it a valuable learning target.

Since I'm still a beginner about compiler and interpreters. It strikes a perfect balance for me.


Enjoy.
