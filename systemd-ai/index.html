# systemd & AI

Let's put the two most hated things in tech together and start solving problems.

## I don't need to productize everything before I start solving problems

In this age, people rush to productize everything. They want to build a SaaS, a startup, a company. They want to make money from us. Everyone wants to be a thought leader, a solopreneur, a billionaire.

But I want to solve problems. I don't need to make a product out of it. I want to make it work for me, or for someone else who has the same problem.

Most SaaS are just glorified cron jobs and glue scripts with a web interface, tied to a payment system and vendor lock-in. I don't need that.

## I don't need a platform to start solving problems

AI is pretty good at adminstrating linux boxes. It's also pretty good at coding. Nowadays I gave it a linux box (in docker or VM) and tell it what I want to do. It will install everything, set up systemd services and monitoring, and even set up CI/CD pipelines (which is usually just a RSync) for me.

Predictable cost, safe sandboxes, easy to debug, and I can shut it down when I don't need it. For auth, plain old ssh port forwarding with public key is good enough. Use something like wireguard if you fancy.
