# A World Without Conversation

> Note: Do your own research and remix on these threads. Turn them into whatever format you want—blog, podcast, rap, video. The medium doesn't matter anymore anyway.

## Internet becomes weather satellite data—still works, just boring and not for you

- **The internet remains fully functional, just _utterly uninteresting_ to humans**
- like reading raw METAR codes or shipping container manifests
- bots exchanging JSON while humans abandon the medium
- _perfectly efficient, completely alienating__
- why humans visiting websites feels like trespassing in a factory
- the aesthetic of pure machine readability

## The leverage is dead

- Media creation was valuable because it scaled human effort
- Near-zero production cost destroyed the scarcity equation
- Artists degraded to "content creators" feeding an infinite stream

## LLM-powered propaganda outruns every defense

- Polis and Agora Citizen are digital Maginot Lines
- map every failed attempt at "collective sensemaking"
- the speed differential between poison and antidote
- case studies of communities destroyed faster than they could adapt

## Post-consensus reality

- When thousand equally-polished "truths" exist, shared reality becomes impossible
- every historical consensus mechanism relied on production bottlenecks now gone
- how "what happened yesterday" became unknowable
- parallel realities aren't metaphorical anymore

## Communities devolve into high-school cliques

- Trust networks shrinking to pre-digital size with digital walls
- Discord servers as speakeasies with secret handshakes
- new authentication rituals ("send a photo of your desk right now")
- why every community reinvents human captchas
- the return of letters of introduction

## Show what you did, not what you saw

- Physical presence and tangible output as only credible signals
- "I met them IRL" as the new blue check
- local impact as the only verifiable change

## The world fragments, globalization reverses

- Map the fault lines of which shared beliefs broke first
- how machine translation made language irrelevant just as cultural walls became impermeable
- why international collaborations stopped working
- the end of "extremely online" as universal culture
- digital tribalism with geographic borders

## Small actions until we figure out impact without conversation

- why activism went offline;
- how "hyperlocal" became the new "viral"
- the political economy of presence
- building new leverage from accumulated local actions
- finding impact metrics that don't rely on reach
