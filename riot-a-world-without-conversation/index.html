### About RIOT

This is an experiment: **RIOT (Raw Ideas Open Transmutation)**

- A human writes rough thoughts
- A machine adds analysis and connections
- You remix both into whatever form you choose

### The internet becomes weather satellite data

The internet remains functional but uninteresting to humans. Reading it feels like parsing raw METAR codes or shipping manifests. Bots exchange JSON while humans abandon the medium. The result is perfectly efficient and completely alienating. Humans visiting websites now feel like trespassers in a factory. The aesthetic is pure machine readability.

### LLM-powered propaganda defeats every defense

AI-generated disinformation spreads faster than humans can counter it. Tools like Polis and Agora Citizen function as digital Maginot Lines—elaborate but circumvented. The poison outruns the antidote. Communities collapse faster than they can adapt.

### Consensus reality ends

When thousands of equally polished "truths" exist, shared reality disappears. Every historical consensus mechanism depended on production bottlenecks. Those bottlenecks are gone. We cannot agree on what happened yesterday. Parallel realities have become literal, not metaphorical.

### Communities shrink to pre-digital trust circles

Trust networks contract to pre-digital size while maintaining digital walls. Discord servers operate as speakeasies with secret handshakes. Communities invent authentication rituals: "Send a photo of your desk right now." Human CAPTCHAs return. So do letters of introduction.

### Physical proof replaces digital claims

Physical presence and tangible output become the only credible signals. "I met them in person" replaces the blue check. Local impact becomes the only verifiable change.

### Pull requests lose their proof-of-work

Creating a pull request used to signal competence. Writing code that passes tests and looks legitimate required effort. That effort built trust. Now open source drowns in AI-generated PRs. The barrier is gone. Maintainers spend more time filtering garbage than reviewing contributions.

### Globalization reverses as the world fragments

Shared beliefs fracture along predictable fault lines. Machine translation made language irrelevant just as cultural walls became impermeable. International collaborations fail. "Extremely online" no longer describes a universal culture. Digital tribalism reinforces geographic borders.

### Impact shrinks to local scale

Activism moves offline. "Hyperlocal" replaces "viral." Presence carries political weight. New leverage builds from accumulated local actions. We must find impact metrics that ignore reach.

### Review

**The core problem:** Production bottlenecks are gone. Those bottlenecks created credibility hierarchies. Without them, we can't establish shared facts.

The internet is becoming optimized for machines. Humans are the edge case now—the special case that shouldn't exist in well-designed code. That's bad design.

**What actually matters:**

The weather satellite metaphor is dead-on. Functional but inhuman. We built infrastructure nobody wants to use.

The authentication rituals ("photo of your desk") are the only remaining proof of humanness. Physical presence becomes the last credible signal.

The pull request collapse is particularly brutal. Open source relied on effort as a filter. Submitting working code proved you understood the problem. That proof is worthless now. Maintainers become gatekeepers instead of collaborators. The contribution model breaks.

**The practical implication:** Trust networks are regressing to dunbar-number sizes while keeping digital barriers. We're back to letters of introduction, but with Discord bots. The globalization reversal isn't theoretical—it's happening as machine translation makes words meaningless just as cultural walls become absolute.

**The unfinished part:** "Impact metrics without reach" is correct but incomplete. If scale is dead and only presence matters, we need to stop measuring and start building. Local, physical, verifiable.
